### What I learned

This project was my first challenge from Frontend Mentor. I tackled it with the goal of applying my frontend knowledge in a real-world scenario. As a result, I encountered many new experiences throughout development. Despite facing some challenges, it was a fun experience.

I began studying JavaScript a few months ago, and my understanding was primarily limited to the fundamentals. This project provided a valuable opportunity to deepen my practical grasp of the language. I still have a lot to learn, but I am proud of the result!
