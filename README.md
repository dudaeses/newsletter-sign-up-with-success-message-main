## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This was my first Frontend Mentor challenge. I started studying JavaScript a few months ago, and until then, my knowledge was limited to the basics. But with this project, I was able to learn more about the language and how it works in practice, not only in JavaScript but also in frontend development as a whole.

I still have a lot to learn, but I'm proud of the result!
